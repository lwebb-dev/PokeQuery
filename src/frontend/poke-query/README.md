# PokeQuery React SPA

This project is a rewrite of the original Svelte + TypeScript SPA, now using React, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It queries a RESTful API for search results and displays matching JSON objects. The design matches the original Svelte app.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```powershell
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the development server:
   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```

## Tech Stack
- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS

## API
- Uses the same RESTful API endpoints as the original Svelte app.

## Styling
- Tailwind CSS is used to match the original design.

## Next Steps
- Migrate components and logic from Svelte to React.
- Implement search and results display.
- Ensure feature and design parity.
